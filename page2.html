    <h1>This Page Utilizes CSS Styling</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Back to Page 1</a>
    <p>This html page is linked to a CSS styling sheet that will affect only this page.<br>
    Right now, all paragraphs will have a red solid border around it with 30 px of padding 
    <b>white space inside a border.</b></p>
    <p>Second paragraph, with the same styling added automatically.</p>
  </body>
  <p id = "marginP"> Using the id attribute I can create styling to affect only certain parts by name. 
      <br>
      This paragraph has margins applied to it. <b>This is the space outside a border</b>.
      <br> However, for some reason the border and padding properties are still being carried over?
      <br> Is this because the p tag overrides ids?.
  </p>
  <p class = "error">This is the 'error' class, an arbitrary name i've given it meaning the type will be styled in red.
      <br>I'm not entirely sure what the difference between <i>id</i> and <i>class</i> is. </p>
  <p id = "linkinfo">There are defaults applied to links <small>(according to w3schools)</small>:<ul>
          <li style = color:blue;><ins>an unvisited link is underlined and in blue.</ins> </li>
          <li style = color:purple;><ins>a visited link is underlined and purple</ins></li>
          <li style = color:red;><ins>an active link is underlined and red</ins>
      </ul>
     Those defaults can be styled with CSS. My favorite is adding color on a mouse hover.
     <a href = "https://github.com/mayapruitt/A1_NetArt">TEST STYLED LINK</a>
     <button><a href = "index.html">Button that links</a></button>
      </p>
  <p>I am going to pause this for now. Looking forward to learning more about formatting, divs, and blocks.<br>
Thanks for visiting! Bye for now!</p>
