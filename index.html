        <h4>This is a header 4</h4>
        <h5>This is a header 5</h5>
        <h6>This is a header 6</h6>
        <p>This is a paragaph. Surprisingly, Header 6 is in a smaller font size 
            than the paragraph text. Would this change with font? 
            How do you change line breaks in paragaphs?</p>
        <p>If I have a "return" in the code will it appear as whitespace on the website? 
        The answer is no, but it will make your code more readable.

        <p>Here are some links to HTML resources I am following to make this first website:</p>
        <a href = https://github.com/itp-dwd/2020-spring/blob/master/guides/html-guide.md>a link</a>
        <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp>another link</a>
        <p>these links appear on the same line.</p>

        Why doesn't it use /img>? How do you add images that are not already on the web -->
