        <h1>This is a website about learning to make my first website</h1>
        <h1>This is a header 1</h1>
        <h2>This is a header 2</h2>
        <h3>This is a header 3</h3>
        <h4>This is a header 4</h4>
        <h5>This is a header 5</h5>
        <h6>This is a header 6</h6>
        <p>This is a paragaph. Surprisingly, Header 6 is in a smaller font size 
            than the paragraph text. Would this change with font? 
            How do you change line breaks in paragaphs?</p>
        <p>If I have a "return" in the code will it appear as whitespace on the website? 
        The answer is no, but it will make your code more readable.
        </p>
        <p>I discovered that window sizes will change linebreaks, but it hasn't been set in the source code.</p>
        <p>Here are some links to HTML resources I am following to make this first website:</p>
        <a href = https://github.com/itp-dwd/2020-spring/blob/master/guides/html-guide.md>a link</a>
        <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp>another link</a>
        <p>these links appear on the same line.</p>
        <p>Adding an image, set the size:</p>
        <img width="512" height="268" alt="Online HTML editor" src = https://www.techjockey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HTML-Editor-Online_feature.png>
        <!--The attributes of the image (width, height, alt, src) can appear in any order within the <img> tag
        Why doesn't it use /img>? How do you add images that are not already on the web -->
        <button>this is a button, but nothing happens yet if you click it</button>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a list</li>
            <li>it indents</li>
            <li>and adds bullet points</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>This is an ordered list</li>
            <li>it also indents</li>
            <li>but it numbers the items instead</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With further reading I have discovered <br> how to make line breaks</p>
        <p style = "color:blue">You can style some things within HTML itself, without CSS. <br> 
            like changing the color of this text.</p>
        <p title = "I'm a tooltip">
            When you mouse over this text a popup will appear.<br>
            Can I change the styling on this?
        </p>
        <h1 style = "font-size: 60px">I can style the size of headings, this is a header 1, but bigger!</h1>
        <p>I can create a horizontal rule or line to break up the content</p>
        <hr>
        <pre>
        The pre tag is preformated text. 
            
            It will follow the line breaks and indentations
          
            of the 
          
            source code. 
            and the default font is courier.
          </pre>
        <p style = "background-color: powderblue;"> Styling can be added to any HTML element. This background color is affecting just this paragraph.</p>
