# A1_NetArt

## Set Up:
You can visit this site at any time by visiting this link on [glitch:](https://a1-netart.glitch.me)

If you want to run the project locally, follow the following steps:

1. Clone this github folder to your preferred location on your computer. 
2. Use the Terminal to cd to this project. 
3. Start a local server using the command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
4. Go to your browser and type: http://localhost:8000 

## Process:

For this first website I wanted to keep things incredibly simple. My goal was to reinforce my learning by creating HTML elements that describe exactly what they are doing. 

If you read from the top of the page to the bottom you will see my inner monologue as I went along. Sometimes my questions would be answered in just a few lines. 

After utilizing HTML, I switched over to CSS. However, It was important to me that the CSS styling didn't effect the first HTML page. I wanted to show the contrast of using external CSS styling and how it can effect an entire page or website. 

I created two separate .html files, and the .css file only applies to "page2.html". You can see my code in this repo for more details for how these links work. 

My inspiration came from all the tutorials I have viewed throughout my time at ITP, both good and bad. Though I viewed this after making the website, it is very much in the style a la Joey's [markdown tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cpwhFHE6hc&list=PLqN0DSYPddBT4-meaRliR3lxVon0IFIza) I don't know if this will be helpful to anyone but me, but I like that it directly matches HTML tags to their visual outcome. This is how I best learn coding. 

My initial hurdle was getting acclimated to the git tracking process. I have attempted this so many times before. SOmething about using the terminal and ssh keys made it seem very daunting. After doing it repeatedly making this project though, I no longer feel that way. In fact, it feels easy now! And incredibly useful in tracking changes over time. 

### Deploying to glitch:
These are the steps I took to deploy my website to glitch. 
1. Make sure the git repo is public 
2. Make sure the git repo is up to date 
3. Copy the repo link
4. Create a new project on glitch 
5. Open "Tools" --> Git, Import, and Export
6. Click "Import from Github", pase the repo link
7. Press "ok" and watch your code magically appear.
